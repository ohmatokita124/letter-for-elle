                <h1>Good morning, Elle!</h1>
                <p>Elle! By the time you wake up, I’ll have turned a random bout of boredom into this little letter for you. It’s about 12 AM, almost 1 AM, and I hope you’re sleeping peacefully by now. When you read this, it’ll be morning, so I’ll do my best to start your day with a smile (or at least some confusion).</p>
                <p>First of all, I would like to say that I hope you know how much I appreciate your presence, even in the quietest of moments. You have this way of making everything feel just a bit brighter, whether it’s with your smile, your laugh, or the way you simply exist. It’s honestly kind of incredible how much you impact the world around you without even trying.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I want to apologize if I ever seem like I’m rambling or getting caught up in my thoughts. It’s just that sometimes, when I start thinking about you, I can’t help but let the words spill out. I’ll just chalk it up to how inspiring you are maybe I’m getting a little sentimental, but who wouldn’t be with someone as wonderful as you?</p>
                <p>And above all, I want to wish you the freedom to always be you. In a world that constantly tells us to change or fit into certain molds, I hope you never feel pressured to do anything other than exactly what feels right for you. Your uniqueness is something special, and it’s honestly a privilege to witness the way you move through life effortlessly authentic, unapologetically yourself. Please, always stay true to who you are, because the world is better for it.</p>
                <p>To wrap this up (before I keep rambling on), I just want to remind you how much you mean to me. Your kindness, your intelligence, your sense of humor all the little things make a big difference. So, here's to a fantastic morning and a day as wonderful as you are.</p>
